            <h3>"Kwitter": A Twitter Clone</h3>
            <img src="images\messages_mockup.png" />
            <p>
              For this project my classmates and I were assigned teams to work
              in, along with the roles each of us would be playing. The
              objective of this project was to create a base application for a
              Twitter clone. The finished app was supposed to be able to intake
              a users login information, and allow them to tweet, and like or
              dislike their tweets on their own profile page. The app was the
              present to a group of instructors from our bootcamp and was graded
              based on design, utility, and our own individual contributions. My
              main role on the team was to design the layout and look of the
              app, including a mockup of the design, and the front-end html and
              css to go along with it.

            <h3>Sports Game in REACT</h3>
            <img src="images\sportsGame.png" />
            <p>
              This project was part of an introduction into REACT. Our main goal
              was to build upon a pre-existing sports "game" that we had built
              as an introduction into JavaScript. The main functions of the app
              were to allow each user to take shots using a shoot button, then,
              at random chance, award the user a goal or no goal, which would
              then raise their score depending on the outcome. I used my skills
              in both html and css to also insert graphics of some real life
              sports teams to use in the game, and I also imported sounds that
              were similar to hockey player shooting pucks for each shot, and a
              goal horn for each successful shot.

            <h3>Virtual Pet</h3>
            <img src="images\virtualPet.png" />
            <p>
              This project was all about creating our very own version of the
              classic toy "Tomagotchi". As an introduction to Java and beyond,
              we were tasked with creating an app that would allow you to take
              care of you very own veritual pet. Depending on the users choices,
              they could feed, water, and play with the pet, which would effect
              the pets statistics in different categories depending on what they
              chose. Eventually the project grew to allow the user to both
              adopt, and bring in their own pets into the pet shelter, where
              they could name the pets, give a brief description, and interact
              with the new pets that were added.
